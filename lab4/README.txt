I spent most of the lab trying to fix my postgresql linkage. Apparently as I installed it with homebrew, NodeJS files were getting in the way.
I tried to follow the lab as much as I could but unfortunately I didn't get far at all. I am going to complete them tonight and
follow up with the TA's with additional questions as I finish it in my time.
I do understand the material as I did the readings and asked TA's questions during the lab in order to make sure that
despite it not working, I could at least comprehend what should have happened.

Thank you.
